The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.
Each player starts with two cards, one of the dealer's cards is hidden until the end.
To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.
If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you get a blackjack (instant win).
Blackjack usually means you win 1.5 the amount of your bet. Depends on the casino.
The dealer will hit until his/her cards total 17 or higher i.e once the player chooses to hold (and they aren't busted yet) the dealer has to open the hidden card and keep hitting until the sum is 17 or more
If the dealer gets busted, the player wins
